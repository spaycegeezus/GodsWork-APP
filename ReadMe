üåç GodsWork App ‚Äî The JOULES Exchange System ‚ö°

A decentralized socioeconomic platform for real-world task tracking, corporate accountability, and equitable compensation.

‚ú® Overview

GodsWork is a purpose-driven application built to measure, record, and reward human effort through a standardized unit of exchange called JOULES ‚Äî a quantifiable representation of personal or corporate contribution.

The system enables individuals, organizations, and communities to log tasks, self-report contributions, and exchange value transparently ‚Äî bypassing traditional monetary hierarchies.

Each recorded Joule represents measurable energy expenditure or service provided, allowing fair trade, transparent accounting, and social synchronization across regions.
