## GodsWork App — The JOULES Exchange System ⚡

A decentralized socioeconomic platform for real-world task tracking, corporate accountability, and equitable compensation.

## Overview

GodsWork is a purpose-driven application built to measure, record, and reward human effort through a standardized unit of exchange called JOULES — a quantifiable representation of personal or corporate contribution.

The system enables individuals, organizations, and communities to log tasks, self-report contributions, and exchange value transparently — bypassing traditional monetary hierarchies.

Each recorded Joule represents measurable energy expenditure or service provided, allowing fair trade, transparent accounting, and social synchronization across regions.

## Core Concept: JOULES as a Unit of Exchange

Function	Description: 
Self-Reporting	Users record completed tasks or community contributions.
Verification System	Reports can be verified by peers, corporate systems, or IoT-linked devices.
Exchange of Joules	Users and corporations trade Joules in exchange for labor, innovation, or energy.
Compensation Layer	Corporations compensate participants proportionally through the Joules system.
Global Synchronization	Cross-compatible data handler aligns Joule data with region-specific databases.


## Debugging : Current known issues
- Service screen only deletes the top service and any other attempts to delete a service row results in the removal of the lower files on the user screen until refreshed by Global Refresh button. 
- Joules rewards are not fully threshed out based on the appropriate calculations of the database. 
- Text Boxes for username and password are sized to fit the screen so appear really large on PC. 
- Aesthetic for profile is not fully implemented as the image upload option is limited to local use. 
- Profile Theme may still have an updating issue.
